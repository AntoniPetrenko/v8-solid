This project aims to optimize computing resources while adhering to best coding practices. The focus is on enhancing readability, reliability, maintainability, and testability of the code. Various programming paradigms are explored, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP), and procedural approaches.

## Tasks

The following tasks will be addressed:

- **Resource Optimization**:
    - Optimize processor and memory usage.

- **Cognitive Complexity**:
    - Minimize cognitive complexity in the codebase to facilitate understanding.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) & Separation of Concerns (SoC)**:
    - Ensure that each component has a single responsibility and that concerns are separated effectively.

- **Readability and Reliability**:
    - Improve code readability and overall reliability of the software.

- **Maintainability, Reusability, Flexibility**:
    - Optimize the code for easy maintenance, reusability, and flexibility for future changes.

- **Testability**:
    - Design the code in a way that makes it easily testable.

- **Unit Testing**:
    - Implement simple unit tests without relying on external frameworks.

- **Multiple Paradigms**:
    - Explore and implement solutions using various programming paradigms (OOP, FP, procedural, and mixed).
